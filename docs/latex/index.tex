$\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+\+Note\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$ when using SLAM, you may use the {\ttfamily teleop\+\_\+twist\+\_\+joy} package to control and move the robot around with a bluetooth joystick. To be able to use bluetooth inside a container {\ttfamily dbus} must be started as the first process, and also you have to run the bluetooth daemon. To this end, you have to modify the {\ttfamily Dockerfile} entrypoint from {\ttfamily \mbox{[}\char`\"{}bash\char`\"{}\mbox{]}} to {\ttfamily sh docker\+\_\+entrypoint.\+sh} \end{quote}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{planning\+\_\+bridge}}\+: contains the interface between the planning and the ground robot navigation package
\item {\bfseries{planning\+\_\+bridge\+\_\+msgs}}\+: contains custom msg and services used by the planning bridge package
